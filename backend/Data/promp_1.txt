# Task: Create Comprehensive Tourism Category System with Smart Filtering

## Objective
Research and create a structured categorization system for a travel planning application. The system will help users select preferences to find specific places, activities, and restaurants in their chosen destination.

---

## KNOWN USER DATA (available before category selection)

The system receives these inputs BEFORE showing category lists:

### 1. Location
- Country (e.g., "Italy")
- City (e.g., "Rome")
- City will have predefined tags (urban/coastal/mountain, region, climate, etc.)

### 2. Travel Dates
- Exact dates → derive SEASON:
  - winter (Dec-Feb)
  - spring (Mar-May)
  - summer (Jun-Aug)
  - autumn (Sep-Nov)
- Also detect: holidays (Christmas, New Year, Easter, etc.)

### 3. Trip Type
```
solo_trip              # traveling alone
romantic_couple        # honeymoon, anniversary, romantic getaway
couple_travel          # two friends, non-romantic pair
family_young_children  # families with children under 12
family_teens           # families with teenagers 13+
group_friends          # friend groups (3+)
business_travel        # work-related travel
```

### 4. Budget Level
```
budget      # $ - cost-conscious travelers
mid_range   # $$ - comfortable spending
luxury      # $$$ - premium experiences
```

---

## DELIVERABLES

### 1. THREE SEPARATE HIERARCHICAL LISTS

Create three distinct, non-overlapping lists:

#### A) PLACES TO VISIT
Categories of attractions and points of interest (NOT activities — things you GO TO and SEE).

Examples: museums, parks, viewpoints, historical sites, markets, neighborhoods, monuments, beaches, gardens.

Structure:
- Main category (e.g., "Cultural Sites")
  - Subcategory (e.g., "Museums", "Galleries", "Theaters")

#### B) ACTIVITIES & EXPERIENCES  
Things to DO (actions, experiences, tours, classes — things you PARTICIPATE IN).

Examples: surfing lessons, wine tasting tours, cooking classes, hiking, city walking tours, spa treatments, snorkeling trips.

Structure:
- Main category (e.g., "Water Sports")
  - Subcategory (e.g., "Surfing", "Scuba Diving", "Kayaking")

#### C) FOOD & DINING
Three sub-sections required:

**C1) Cuisine Types** (WHAT to eat)
- All major world cuisines organized by region
- Include regional variations where significant (e.g., Cantonese vs Sichuan)

**C2) Dining Formats** (WHERE/HOW to eat)
- Examples: fine dining, street food, food markets, cafes, rooftop restaurants, food halls, local taverns

**C3) Dietary Preferences** (special requirements)
- Examples: vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher, gluten-free, organic, farm-to-table

### 2. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TAG SYSTEM

Each subcategory MUST have tags across ALL dimensions:

#### A) GEOGRAPHY TAGS (for location-based filtering)
```
[GEO_TYPE]: coastal, mountain, desert, tropical, arctic, urban, rural, island, riverside, lakeside, forest, plains, volcanic
[GEO_REGION]: western_europe, eastern_europe, northern_europe, southern_europe, east_asia, southeast_asia, south_asia, central_asia, middle_east, north_africa, sub_saharan_africa, north_america, central_america, south_america, caribbean, oceania, pacific_islands
[INFRASTRUCTURE]: developed, developing, remote, adventure_infrastructure
```

#### B) SEASON TAGS (for date-based filtering)
```
[SEASON]: winter, spring, summer, autumn, all_season
[SEASON_SPECIAL]: christmas_period, new_year, easter, summer_holidays, ski_season, monsoon_avoid, cherry_blossom, autumn_foliage, carnival_season, ramadan
[WEATHER_REQUIREMENT]: warm_weather_required, cold_weather_required, dry_weather_required, any_weather
```

#### C) TRIP TYPE TAGS (for traveler filtering)
```
[TRIP_IDEAL]: solo_trip, romantic_couple, couple_travel, family_young_children, family_teens, group_friends, business_travel
[TRIP_EXCLUDE]: not_for_young_children, not_for_toddlers, not_for_business, not_for_solo, adults_only, not_for_seniors
[AGE_APPROPRIATE]: all_ages, adults_only, teens_and_up, family_oriented, senior_friendly
```

#### D) BUDGET TAGS (for budget filtering)
```
[BUDGET_LEVEL]: budget, mid_range, luxury, free, varies_widely
[BUDGET_EXCLUDE]: not_for_budget, not_for_luxury, premium_only
```

#### E) SPECIAL CHARACTERISTIC TAGS
```
[LOGISTICS]: requires_advance_booking, requires_license, requires_guide, requires_equipment, walk_in_ok
[TIMING]: seasonal_only, weather_dependent, time_specific, available_daily, weekend_only, nighttime_only
[PHYSICAL]: physically_demanding, moderate_activity, low_activity, accessibility_friendly, wheelchair_accessible
[VIBE]: instagram_worthy, hidden_gem, touristy, local_favorite, off_beaten_path, bucket_list, romantic_setting, family_friendly_atmosphere, party_atmosphere, quiet_relaxing
```

### 4. REQUIREMENTS

   - Bad: "Wine Tourism" + "Vineyard Tours" + "Wine Tasting" as separate items
   - Good: "Wine & Vineyard Experiences" as ONE category in activities

2. **Strict list separation**: Each item belongs to ONLY ONE of three lists

   - "Guided Museum Tour" = ACTIVITY (structured experience, you do something)
   - "Museum Café" = DINING FORMAT (you eat there)

3. **Comprehensive but practical**: 
   - 15-25 main categories per list
   - 3-10 subcategories per main category
   - Target: ~100-150 total subcategories per list (not 300+)

4. **Complete tagging**: EVERY subcategory MUST have tags in ALL 5 dimensions (A through E)

5. **Cuisine completeness**: Include minimum 60 distinct cuisines covering all world regions

6. **Web Research Required**:
   - Search for comprehensive world cuisine lists by region
   - Search for TripAdvisor, Viator, GetYourGuide activity categorization
   - Search for Google Things To Do categories
   - Search for trending tourism categories 2024-2025
   - Search for family-friendly vs adults-only classifications

### REFERENCE: Existing Category List

Below is an initial list collected earlier. Use it as:
- A checklist to ensure completeness (don't miss valuable niche categories)
- NOT as a structure to follow (create your own clean hierarchy)
- Identify duplicates to merge
- Some items may be outdated or too niche — use judgment

## FINAL NOTES

- Focus on creating a CLEAN, USABLE structure — not maximum length
- Every category should generate useful search results when combined with a city name
- Think from USER perspective: "Would I want to select this when planning a trip?"
- Merge aggressively: fewer well-defined categories > many overlapping ones
