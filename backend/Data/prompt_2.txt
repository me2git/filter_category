# Task: Create Comprehensive City Database with Tourism Tags

## Objective
Create a structured database of tourist destination cities with tags that enable smart filtering of tourism categories. These city tags will be matched against category requirement tags to show only relevant options to users.

---

## TAG SYSTEM (must match category tags from the category system)

City tags must use the SAME vocabulary as category requirement tags for matching to work.

## REQUIREMENTS

1. **Complete coverage**: Every city from the list must have an entry

2. **Accurate tagging**: Research each city to ensure tags are accurate
   - Use web search to verify climate, features, tourism characteristics
   - Check what each city is actually known for

3. **Multiple geo_type when applicable**: 
   - Sydney = ["urban", "coastal"]
   - Queenstown = ["urban", "mountain", "lakeside"]

4. **Seasonal accuracy**:
   - Northern hemisphere: winter = Dec-Feb
   - Southern hemisphere: winter = Jun-Aug
   - Tag seasonal features according to the LOCAL season

5. **Honest tourism_characteristics**: Only add characteristics the city is genuinely known for
   - Don't add "beach_destination" to Prague
   - Don't add "ski_resort" to Miami

6. **Web Research Required**:
   - Verify climate data for each city
   - Check major tourism features
   - Verify seasonal events (cherry blossom in Japan = spring, etc.)
   - Check infrastructure level
   - Verify special features (UNESCO sites, legal status of cannabis/gambling, etc.)

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] All ~150 cities from the list have entries
- [ ] Every city has ALL tag categories filled (geo_type, geo_region, climate_type, etc.)
- [ ] Tags use EXACT vocabulary from the tag system above (no variations)
- [ ] Seasonal features are accurate for each hemisphere
- [ ] Beach cities have "coastal" in geo_type
- [ ] Mountain cities have "mountain" in geo_type
- [ ] Island destinations have "island" in geo_type
- [ ] Climate types are accurate (Mediterranean cities have "mediterranean", etc.)
- [ ] UNESCO sites are correctly tagged
- [ ] Known party destinations have "party_destination" and "nightlife_hub"
- [ ] Known romantic destinations have "romantic_destination"
- [ ] Family-friendly destinations (Orlando, etc.) have "family_destination"

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Tag consistency is critical**: If a tag doesn't exist in the vocabulary above, DON'T INVENT NEW ONES. Use only the defined tags.

2. **Be comprehensive but accurate**: Better to have fewer accurate tags than many questionable ones.

3. **Think about matching**: These tags will be matched against category requirements. Ask yourself: "If someone wants surfing, will they find cities with surf_spots? If someone travels in winter, will they find christmas_markets in the right cities?"

4. **Regional variations**: Some cities span concepts:
   - Istanbul = can be tagged both "southern_europe" AND "middle_east"
   - Hawaii = "north_america" but with "tropical" climate
   - Use judgment and include what helps tourists find it

5. **Add any missing major tourist destinations**: If you know of important cities not on the list, add them.
