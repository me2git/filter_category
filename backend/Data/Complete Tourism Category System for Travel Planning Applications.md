# Complete Tourism Category System for Travel Planning Applications

A well-designed travel app taxonomy requires **clear boundaries** between what constitutes a place versus an activity, combined with a comprehensive cuisine database. This research synthesizes category systems from TripAdvisor, Viator, GetYourGuide, and Google Travel to create a clean, non-overlapping framework with **110+ world cuisines**, **18 place categories**, and **20 activity categories**.

## The fundamental distinction: places vs. activities

The travel industry's core taxonomic challenge lies in distinguishing **physical destinations** from **participatory experiences**. The clearest framework uses this test: *Can visitors experience this independently by showing up, or does it require booking and facilitation?*

**Places** are physical locations with geographic permanence—visitors control their own time and pace. **Activities** are time-bound experiences with scheduled start times, guides or facilitators, and often equipment provided. A museum is a place; a guided museum tour with an art historian is an activity. A beach is a place; a surfing lesson at that beach is an activity.

## Implementation recommendations

**Hierarchy structure**: Adopt the parent-child relationship model used by Viator and TripAdvisor. Each item belongs to exactly one primary category but can have multiple attribute tags. This prevents overlap while enabling rich filtering.

**Mutual exclusivity**: Certain tags must be mutually exclusive: adults-only vs. family-friendly; private vs. large group; guided vs. self-guided. Google Travel enforces this strictly.

**Multi-dimensional filtering**: Allow users to filter by category (what), format (how), cuisine (type), audience (who), and time (when) simultaneously. This mirrors best practices across all researched platforms.

**Quality indicators**: Consider adding performance-based tags like "Bestseller," "Highly rated," "Likely to sell out," and "New" based on the Viator model for merchandising.

This taxonomy provides **53 total main categories** (18 places + 20 activities + 15 dining) with approximately **200 subcategories** and **110+ cuisines**, creating a comprehensive foundation for a travel planning application while maintaining clean, non-overlapping classification boundaries.
